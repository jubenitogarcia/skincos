# TASKS

## External/product follow-up

- [ ] Confirm or reauthorize the `Google Calendar (Skincos)` credential for the exact scopes required by the inactive clinic Orb workflows.
- [ ] Provide `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID`, approved test data and a non-production-safe validation window before enabling a workflow that can create a real calendar event or booking.

## Done — architecture and runtime program

- [x] Domain roots, gateway boundary, Booking/EF contracts, runtime units and lifecycle launchers were versioned and integrated through reviewed PRs.
- [x] The seven final services were cut over to native Linux source/state/config/log paths; no active process uses DrvFS or a temporary worktree.
- [x] Windows-to-Linux state transfer, checksum validation, private ownership/permissions and restart persistence were proven.
- [x] A full Orb backup was checksum-validated and restored, including PostgreSQL and storage evidence; rollback checkpoint and prior releases remain available.
- [x] Reachable critical/high CodeQL and Semgrep findings in CRM, Website, Orb and Messaging were corrected with regression tests and no broad suppression.
- [x] The single WhatsApp engine was hardened and promoted; local/public authenticated health passed and sessions remained available after restart.
- [x] The CRM HTTP restart/Git mutation path was disabled operationally and removed from code/workflows; GitHub native deploy reconciliation no longer invokes it.
- [x] Retired WhatsApp variants, their launchers, unconsumed UIs, stale docs/templates and scanner-only vendor trees were removed after production proof.
- [x] Canonical code remains `C:\CodexShared\Projetos\skincos`; mutable state and secrets remain outside the shared repository.
- [x] Legacy units, one-time migration launchers, applied workflow patchers and WSL backup timer were retired; daily backup scheduling is Windows-owned and restore-verified.
- [x] Post-cutover Git, runtime, endpoint, scanner, backup, release and sensitive-artifact auditing completed with rollback preserved.
