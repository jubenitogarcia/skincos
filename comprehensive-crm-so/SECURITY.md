Thanks for helping make GitHub safe for everyone.

# Security

GitHub takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including all of the open source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/GitHub).

Even though [open source repositories are outside of the scope of our bug bounty program](https://bounty.github.com/index.html#scope) and therefore not eligible for bounty rewards, we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation. 

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any GitHub-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to opensource-security[@]github.com.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Automated Security Analysis

This repository uses CodeQL for automated static security analysis of JavaScript/TypeScript code. The security analysis:

- **Runs automatically** on every push and pull request to the main branch
- **Scans weekly** on a scheduled basis (Wednesdays at 02:00 UTC)
- **Identifies** common security vulnerabilities early in the development cycle
- **Reports findings** in the Security tab of this repository

The CodeQL analysis helps detect potential security issues such as:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) weaknesses
- Path traversal issues
- Unsafe code patterns
- Data flow vulnerabilities

Security alerts from CodeQL are reviewed and addressed promptly by the development team.
